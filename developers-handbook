Why you have to commitment to writing standard apps?

Generally, you should try to make your code as portable as possible,
as otherwise you may have to completely rewrite the program later to get it to
work somewhere else-and who knows what you may be using in a few years time?

   % cc -Wall -ansi -pedantic -o foobar foobar.c

Without these flags, cc will allow you to use some of its non-standard
extensions to the standard. Some of these are very useful, but will not work
with other compilers-in fact, one of the main aims of the standard is to
allow people to write code that will work with any compiler on any system.
This is known as portable code.
