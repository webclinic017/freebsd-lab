[log] I have read this doc at this day 31-3-2021


*
I was don't remember where is /something/ports ^^'
so, I used that:
$ tree -L 2 | grep ports
$ cd /*/ports

yah ^^' <3


*
FreeBSD is very compatible with standards such as POSIX® and
ANSI C, as well with its own BSD heritage

*
I really like FreeBSD and how they document things <3


*
Programming Interpreters and compilers Ports:
lang/

Where is basic interpreters??
$ cd lang/
$ ls *basic

That's it )) how fun ))


*
How to use X that's exists in /ports ??
well, go there.. $make ,, $make install ,, that's it!!

Why you have to commitment to writing standard apps?

Generally, you should try to make your code as portable as possible,
as otherwise you may have to completely rewrite the program later to get it to
work somewhere else-and who knows what you may be using in a few years time?

   % cc -Wall -ansi -pedantic -o foobar foobar.c

Without these flags, cc will allow you to use some of its non-standard
extensions to the standard. Some of these are very useful, but will not work
with other compilers-in fact, one of the main aims of the standard is to
allow people to write code that will work with any compiler on any system.
This is known as portable code.

core dump ??


*
There are magic behind this line
   .include <bsd.port.mk>
Read:
/usr/share/mk


*
Debugging

The standard debugger supplied with FreeBSD 12.1 is called lldb (LLVM debugger)
   https://lldb.llvm.org/

The other debugger available with FreeBSD is called gdb (GNU debugger)

Which one to use is largely a matter of taste. If familiar with one only, use that one.
