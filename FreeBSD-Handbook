3.3. Users and Basic Account Management
=======================================
FreeBSD allows multiple users to use the computer at the same time.
While only one user can sit in front of the screen and use the keyboard at any one time,
any number of users can log in to the system through the network. To use the system,
each user should have their own user account.

This chapter describes:
- The different types of user accounts on a FreeBSD system.
- How to add, remove, and modify user accounts.
- How to set limits to control the resources that users and groups are allowed to access.
- How to create groups and add users as members of a group.
